**Personal website of Vince Havaway**
Built as a digital calling card, creative sandboz, and resume hub.

## What's here
- A minimalist landing page with animations
- Expandable resume and contact information
- Embedded music player with interface
- Project showcase
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Command palette for keyboard navigation (`CTRL+K` or `/`)

## Why
This website started as a personal experiment--a way to play with front-end interactivity while keeping things clean and simple. It is about expression, not production.

## Tech stack
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) for interactive heat map
- [Fuse.js](https://fusejs.io/) for fuzzy search command palette
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) + [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
